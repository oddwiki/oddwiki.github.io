name: "Fuzzle"

summary: "**Fuzzles** are native wildlife that are generally found in Western Mudos, though they have also been found elsewhere due to some of them being captured by the [Vykker's Conglomerate](/organisations/vykkers-conglomerate)."

description:
  appearance: |
    Fuzzles are spherical, brown-furred creatures whose unassuming form hides a set of large sharp teeth.

  behaviour: |
    Fuzzles are ambush predators. They lie in wait, hidden in places such as bushes and alcoves, until their prey stumbles across them. That is when they pounce, their sharp teeth tearing through their prey's flesh with ease.[^strangers-wrath] They have also shown to be loyal to those who help them, even willing to obey commands.[^munchs-oddysee]
